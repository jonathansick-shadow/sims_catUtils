    """
    This class is designed to operate as a mixin for InstanceCatalog classes.
    It provides a member variable self.cosmology which is an instantiation
    of the CosmologyObject class.  self.cosmology defaults to the
    Milliennium Simulation cosmology.  This mixin also provides a method
    self.setCosmology() which will allow the user to customize self.cosmology
    and a getter for the column cosmologicalDistanceModulus that reflects the
    effect of the luminosity distance on a galaxy's component magnitudes.

    NOTE: one should only include this mixin in catalogs whose magNorm is
    normalized to an absolute magnitude of some sort (i.e. the magnitude if
    the galaxy was at redshift=0).  The magNorms for galaxies stored on the
    University of Washington LSSTCATSIM database do not fit this criterion.
    magNorms on the University of Washington LSSTCATSIM database include the
    effects of cosmological distance modulus.
